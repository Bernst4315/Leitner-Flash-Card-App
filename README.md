# Leitner-FlashCard-App

This is a flashcard application made using React, Javascript, Node.js, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express. It is a study tool useful for a student in high school or university, or for the autodidact learning a new topic. It enables users to create multiple decks of personalized flashcards so that topics can be easily organized.

In the future, it will incorporate the Leitner system, which is a system of spaced repetition. If flashcards are easy, they will come up less often; however, the more difficult ones will appear more frequently. This will allow users to focus on more difficult concepts and streamline the process to comprehension and mastery.
